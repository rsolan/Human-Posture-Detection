# Human-Posture-Detection
Real-Time Human Posture Detection

## Project Overview

Developed a real-time posture detection system using PoseNet, a machine learning model designed to accurately identify and analyze human body postures. The system leverages the PoseNet model to provide precise pose estimation, implemented through JavaScript-based libraries. The integration with TensorFlow.js and ml5.js allows for real-time processing and analysis directly in the browser, while the p5.js library enhances visualization of human movement, making it an effective tool for applications requiring detailed posture analysis.

## Tools Used

PoseNet: A deep learning model for human pose estimation that detects and analyzes various human body postures.

TensorFlow.js: A JavaScript library that enables the development and deployment of machine learning models directly in the browser.

ml5.js: A high-level JavaScript library built on TensorFlow.js, providing easy-to-use interfaces for machine learning models.

p5.js: A JavaScript library for creative coding, used to create interactive visualizations and enhance the display of posture analysis results.


The Real-Time Posture Detection System demonstrates a robust application of deep learning and JavaScript technologies for precise and interactive human posture analysis. By integrating PoseNet with TensorFlow.js, ml5.js, and p5.js, the project achieves effective real-time pose estimation and visualization directly within the browser. This approach not only enhances user engagement through immediate feedback but also offers a scalable and efficient solution for various applications such as fitness, ergonomics, and interactive media. The successful implementation and integration of these tools underscore the potential for advanced, accessible, and real-time machine learning solutions in everyday applications.
